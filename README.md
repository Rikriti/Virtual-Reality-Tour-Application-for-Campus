This project is to develop an App to serve students who want to have a tour of the campus but remotely. Our VR tour application will provide an immersive campus exploration experience, allowing users to virtually navigate through various facilities, classrooms, and common areas. The VR application works by incorporating a 3D representation of the campus environment, created using 360-degree cameras and VR-compatible imagery.
